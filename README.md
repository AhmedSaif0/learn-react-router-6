Hello and welcome! This is the starter code for each scrim in Bob Ziroll's Learn React Router 6 course on Scrimba! ⚛️ 

To follow the course on Scrimba's **interactive code-learning platform**, head to the [Learn React Router 6 page](https://scrimba.com/learn/reactrouter6) on Scrimba!


## Please read this carefully!
This README file is the best "single source of truth" for you to see updates made to the course if you're coming from the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel!

As time passes, dependencies can sometimes become outdated or start exhibiting bugs that weren't there when I first recorded the course.

In the version of this course on Scrimba, it's easy for me to add quick updates and new lessons. However, the course on YouTube is frozen in time and unchangeable. So please come check the "[Updates](#updates)" section below often, as you may find there are important updates that can help you avoid common bugs.


## Setup
Check out [this video](https://youtu.be/IYZQu_UwlpU) for a walkthrough of the steps to get your project set up on your own machine. Or read below

### Instructions

2. `cd` to the main folder in Terminal
3. Run `npm install`
4. (Optional, but preferred) Open just the section folder you're currently working on (e.g. 01 - Introduction to React Router) in your editor
5. `cd` into the section folder, then into the specific lesson folder you're currently on.
6. Run `npm run dev` to spin up the dev server
7. Copy/paste or click on the localhost URL it provides to see the project at the starting point of the lesson
